# Lighting

- Convert to more efficient system (that doesn't rebuild RenderChar)

# Player Controller
- Fix velocity-based movement to allow for faster than max speed impulses
- Additional states (weapons etc)

# Animation Controller
- Create a more usable system of Animation management, perhaps custom animation states
  that store relevant data and can be accessed/swapped to easily

# Camera controller
- Camera smoothing (give camera a target location and have it womp over to it with high accel)
- Ideally a system with a state of which camera entity to use
- Allow for different camera modes (aim at cursor, look-ahead, soft follow, hard follow etc)

# UI
- Implement

# Art
- Round out tileset
